Requires ffmpeg, apache2, php, and likely others.

Does *not* currently require login for the web interface. Keep that in mind if you put this on a publicly accessible server.

Sample crontab (`crontab -e`):

  */15 * * * * /home/USER/security/cam.pl cam1 192.168.1.235 0 rtspusername rtsppassword
  5-59/15 * * * * /home/USER/security/cam.pl cam2 192.168.1.239 300 rtspusername rtsppassword

The second entry will offset the feed for that camera by 5 minutes. The '300' (seconds) argument *must* match this offset.
As of yet no videos will be automatically deleted. Must do it manually.


Sample apache conf entry:

  Alias /security /home/USER/security
  <Directory /home/USER/security>
         Require all granted
 	        Options None
 		</Directory>


Sample fstab entry for ramdisk

  tmpfs /home/USER/security/ramdisk tmpfs rw,relatime,size=4G 0 0
