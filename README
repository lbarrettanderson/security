Requires ffmpeg, apache2, php, and likely others.

WARNINGS:
 - Does *not* currently require login for the web interface. Keep that in mind if you put this on a publicly accessible server.
 - The PHP is highly insecure (uses unsanitized GET parameters).

Sample crontab (`crontab -e`):

*/20 * * * * /home/USER/security/cam2.pl cam1 192.168.1.36 0 rtpuser rtppassword stream0

The last entry is the stream name. 11 is another common one.

Sample apache conf entry:

  Alias /security /home/USER/security
  <Directory /home/USER/security>
         Require all granted
 	        Options None
 		</Directory>


Sample fstab entry for ramdisk

  tmpfs /home/USER/ramdisk tmpfs rw,relatime,size=4G 0 0
